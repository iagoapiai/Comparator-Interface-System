# Comparator-Interface-System
The Python script showcases an interface featuring several functions, with the primary function being the comparison of two tables to display variations. Additionally, the script includes a web scraping function designed to extract desired data from the company's website, saving it in an Excel file for future comparisons. 

It is important to note that this code will only function correctly when the website elements and spreadsheet data are appropriately modified, as well as the directories adjusted.

## WHAT THE SCRIPT DO:
- The interface displays three possible actions: compare, import data, and map companies.
- **Compare**: Opens a new tab where you can select two worksheets to compare. It then displays the treated worksheets in an interface with various functions.
- **Import data**: Scrapes the site to collect information from 47 companies and saves the data in a spreadsheet for future comparison.
- **Map companies**: Maps the companies present on the main website.

## OBSERVATION

This code will only work if you redo the modifications of the dataframe, it also needs to contain a folder called 'statusbolt' to save the excel file!
